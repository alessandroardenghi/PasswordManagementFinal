Our project delivers a ready-to-use password management application designed for iPhone users, developed with Swift. 
The appâ€™s main components are the user-friendly interface, proactive alerts, and the secure storage of sensitive information.

There are minor bugs realted to graphics/error handling which will be fixed with the next release, but currently do not interfere with the app's functionality.

Enjoy!
