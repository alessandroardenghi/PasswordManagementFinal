# üóùÔ∏è PaMa App

## üåü Highlights

Our project delivers a ready-to-use password management application designed for iPhone users, developed with Swift. 
The app‚Äôs main components are the user-friendly interface, proactive alerts, and the secure storage of sensitive information.
Enjoy!


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

We built from scratch an app that can do Password Management. Its main features that differenciate it from other password management services are that it
not only safely stores private information relying on Apple's Keychain, but it also gives the user insights about such information. <br>
The main features are the following:
- **Safe Storage**: as said above, we base our app on Apple's Keychain, which achieves the highest level of security for private information storage
- **User Friendly Interface**: we have a beautifully designed, easy to understand interface which lets the user have control over their data
- **Additional Information**: When saving the login information of a service into PaMa, the user can also record whether they have a subscription and when it ends, and also whether they have inserted additional information like address, date of birth and so on. There is a separate area of the app where the user can visualize how many apps know their address, date of birth and other relevant information
- **Personalized Notifications**: If the user set a subscriptiond date when saving the login info, they will be reminded about it some days before it renews, so as to avoid unwanted renewals. Also, the user will be periodically reminded to change its passwords to protect him from data leaks. Moreover, every year after they have recorded the login information of some website, they will be reminded of the existence of such account, so that they can delete it if they are not using it anymore.
Overall, PaMa makes storing, retrieving and managing login information easy!
