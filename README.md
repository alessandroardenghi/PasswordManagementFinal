This branch is dedicated to the research and development of a backend system that would integrate the app with a cloud server. 
The file webpage.swift will be moved under the directory PasswordManagement once the scraper works and we will continue the implementation of the backend system.

If you have any tips, especially on how to scrape HTML code for embedded web pages, please feel free to reach out!
